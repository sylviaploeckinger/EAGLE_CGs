## Sample of identified Compact Groups of galaxies in EAGLE RefL100N1504
## from Harsuiker and Ploeckinger (MNRAS, accepted 11/2019) 

The CGs here represent the 'completeness-corrected' sample where the redshift distance
of all EAGLE snapshots is assumed to be z=0.025 (see paper for details). 

- **column 0:** CG ID 
- **column 1:** Snapshot number where the CG is identified 
- **column 2:** Case depending on status of CG at next snapshot: 
    - case **0**: not merged, not identified as CG
    - case **1**: merged 
    - case **2**: partly merged 
    - case **3**: not merged, still CG         
- **column 3:** Projection in which the CG is identified (note: some CGs are identified in more than one projection)
- **column 4:** Elongation (s_parallel / s_perpendicular, see Fig. 3)
- **column 5:** First snapshot where all CG members have merged  (-1 if they do not merge until z=0)
- **column 6-10:** GalaxyIDs of CG member from EAGLE database
